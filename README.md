# Collision Insights: Data-Driven Analysis of Motor Vehicle Accidents  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes motor vehicle collision data to uncover trends and hotspots, providing actionable insights for improved traffic safety. Developed as part of the **Data Architecture for Business Intelligence** course, the project demonstrates the design of a robust data pipeline and the use of advanced visualization tools to enhance decision-making for traffic management and accident prevention.

## Key Features  
- **Data Collection and Storage**:  
  - Ingested raw collision data from open datasets using ETL pipelines.  
  - Stored the processed data in a structured format using **AWS S3** and **Snowflake**.  

- **Data Transformation**:  
  - Cleaned and transformed data using **Apache Spark** and **Python** for enhanced quality and consistency.  
  - Designed a star schema in **Snowflake** to optimize query performance.  

- **Visualization**:  
  - Created dynamic dashboards using **Power BI** to visualize accident trends, hotspots, and patterns.  
  - Enhanced decision-making with insights on peak accident times, high-risk zones, and causative factors.

## Steps and Workflow  
1. **Data Ingestion**:  
   - Imported collision data from open data portals and stored it in AWS S3.  

2. **Data Transformation**:  
   - Used Spark to clean and normalize the data.  
   - Designed ETL pipelines to populate the Snowflake data warehouse.  

3. **Visualization**:  
   - Created interactive dashboards to explore and analyze collision trends.  

4. **Reporting**:  
   - Presented findings on accident-prone areas and times, along with key recommendations.

## Insights Derived  
- Identified high-risk areas for motor vehicle collisions in urban regions.  
- Highlighted the correlation between collision frequency and environmental factors like weather and time of day.  
- Proposed actionable recommendations for reducing collision risks.  

---

## Future Enhancements  
- Automate real-time data ingestion for up-to-date analysis.  
- Incorporate machine learning models for predictive analytics on collision trends.  
- Expand the scope to include pedestrian and cyclist collision data.
